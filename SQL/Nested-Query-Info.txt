Nested Subqueries: 
- SQL provides a mechanism for the nesting of subqueries
- A query within another SQL query is called a subquery or inner query or nested query
- It can be used with SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE statements
- It must be enclosed in parenthesis

- A common use of subqueries is to perform test for membership, make set comparison and determine set cardinality by nesting subqueries in WHERE clause

Set Membership: 
SQL allows testing tuples for membership in a relation
- The IN connective tests for set membership(i.e; includes in set) whereas,
NOT IN connective tests for absence of set membership
- Syntax: 
  select column(s) from tbnaem where column oprator (select column(s) form tbname where condition)
  // Here, operator can be IN or NOT IN
