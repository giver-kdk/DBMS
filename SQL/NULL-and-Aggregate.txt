NULL and Aggregate
- All aggregate operations except count(*) ignore tuples with null values on the aggregate attribute.
- So, coutn(*) counts tuples whether there is NULL or not.
- Total all salaries: 
  - select sum(salary) from instructor;
- Above statement igonores null amounts
- Result is null if there is no non-null amount


- What if collection has only null values?, then: 
  - count returns 0
  - All other aggragate functions return NULL
